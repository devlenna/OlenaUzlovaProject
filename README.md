# The Hobby Chest with Threads & Tales

A personal web page created as part of **Step 4** of the *CodeYourFuture: Introduction to Digital Technologies* course.


## About Me

My name is **Olena Uzlova**, though I also go by **Lenna** or **Lennie**.  
I am currently exploring web development through practical projects.  
Earlier, I studied some basics of Java, but I didn’t manage to create a full project with it.

I enjoy learning new things, crocheting, and reading — especially fantasy and science fiction.  
This page reflects my personal interests and my growing confidence in HTML and CSS.


## Project Overview

This web page was built to demonstrate basic web development skills and to share a little about myself. It includes:

- A themed layout with a sidebar and navigation  
- Sections about my hobbies and recommendations  


## Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- External image hosting
